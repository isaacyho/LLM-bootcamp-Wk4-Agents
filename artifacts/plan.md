## Plan for Building the Web Page

### Overview

The provided image depicts a web page with the following elements and layout:

1. **Header Section**:
   - Positioned at the top of the page.
   - Contains a logo on the left and a navigation menu on the right with links such as "Home," "About," "Services," and "Contact."

2. **Hero Section**:
   - Located below the header.
   - Features a large background image with an overlay of text. The text includes a main heading and a subheading, both centered horizontally and vertically within the hero section.

3. **Content Section**:
   - Positioned below the hero section.
   - Consists of multiple subsections, each with a heading and some text. These subsections are arranged in a single column.

4. **Footer Section**:
   - Located at the bottom of the page.
   - Contains contact information and social media icons.

### Layout Implementation Options

1. **Header Section**:
   - **Flexbox**: Using CSS Flexbox for the header allows for easy alignment of the logo and navigation menu. Flexbox is highly recommended due to its simplicity and flexibility.
   - **Grid**: CSS Grid could also be used, but it might be overkill for a simple header layout.

2. **Hero Section**:
   - **Background Image with Text Overlay**: Use CSS to set the background image and position the text using absolute positioning or Flexbox. Flexbox is recommended for centering the text both horizontally and vertically.

3. **Content Section**:
   - **Single Column Layout**: A simple single-column layout can be achieved using standard block elements. Flexbox or CSS Grid can be used if more complex alignment is needed.

4. **Footer Section**:
   - **Flexbox**: Flexbox can be used to align the contact information and social media icons horizontally.
